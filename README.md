# Kaggle Project


Welcome to the Kaggle project repository. This project aims to solve a data science problem using the dataset provided in a Kaggle competition. 
This repository contains the code and resources necessary to preprocess the data, build and train models, and generate predictions that can be submitted to Kaggle.
